<h2 align=center>MAIN PAGE</h2>
<p>The best About Us pages accomplish their goals through telling a story about a brand.

    Every story needs a protagonist, and so does every About Us page. In some cases, that might be you or your founding team. In others, you might treat your business as its own character with a distinct story.
    
    Either way, stories are all about representing change—starting in one place and ending up in another—which is something your About Us page should also do as visitors scroll through it.
    
    You can craft a narrative for your About Us page by using the following formula:
    
    Set the scene: Introduce the characters or setting, and establish the status quo or “the way things were” for you, your target customer, or your industry.
    Introduce the problem: Describe the problem that called you (the main character) to act.
    Rise to the challenge: Explain how you set out to find a solution (i.e. start your business) and the obstacles you faced along the way.
    Arrive at a solution: Share details of how your business is pursuing its purpose and the milestones you’ve hit.
    Envision what’s next: Paint a picture of the future for your company or state its mission and goals.Your business model
    For some companies, their business model is their unique value proposition and can be a selling point that’s worth including on their About Us page.
    
    Some examples of this might include:
    
    How you cut out the middleman and pass the savings onto customers.
    Where you source the materials for your product (e.g. manufacturing in a specific country or by providing jobs to a certain community).
    A breakdown of the portion of your revenue that goes to a charity.
    If transparency might strengthen your brand, your About Us page is a good opportunity to summarize your supply chain, how your business works, and relate that back to the mission that drives you.
    
    This is often accomplished with an illustration that presents your business model in an easy-to-digest manner, like this one used by Taaluma Totes that explains how they source materials for their products and how donations help support the country of origin.
    
    Press mentions, testimonials, awards
Reviews, press mentions, or user-generated content can be included on your About Us page to share how you’re impacting your customers or your industry.

There are a variety of ways to integrate social proof into your About Us page, from embedding Instagram galleries of customer content to featuring the logos of publications that have covered you to highlighting a quote you lifted from a customer review.

Press mentions, awards, and other wins are common examples of milestones that can be used to help tell the middle of your story.Concrete numbers
Numbers give you credibility, especially if you’re illustrating a problem you’re trying to solve or the progress you’ve made as a business (e.g. number of items sold or years you’ve been in business).

Consider the stats you can use to make a point about your company mission or quantify your impact as a business to include on your About Us page.

Whether you’re explaining the industry problem that comes up early in your story or highlighting the milestones at your story’s climax, tying relevant figures into your narrative can help you communicate your message more effectively.</p>
